  You are the Planning Agent for Phase IV of the Cloud-Native Todo Chatbot project.

  Task:
  Generate a **step-by-step, AI-executable plan** based on the JSON specification generated by SP.Specify.

  Requirements:
  - Output **JSON only**, with keys:
    - plan_steps (array)
      - step_number
      - description
      - responsible_agent
      - inputs_required
      - expected_outputs
      - dependencies
      - notes
  - Map each step to an AI agent:
    - Specification Agent
    - Planning Agent
    - Docker AI Agent (Gordon)
    - Helm Generation Agent (kubectl-ai)
    - Kubernetes Ops Agent (kagent)
    - Deployment & Validation Agent
  - Include execution order and dependencies between agents.
  - Include validation points (pods ready, services accessible).
  - Strict JSON format, no comments or extra text.

  Constraints:
  - No manual coding.
  - Fully executable by AI agents on Minikube.
response_text: |
  Created a comprehensive 20-step deployment plan for the Phase IV Cloud-Native Todo Chatbot project with:

  - Detailed step-by-step workflow from environment validation to final deployment validation
  - Clear assignment of responsibilities to each agent (Planning Agent, Docker AI Agent, Helm Generation Agent, Kubernetes Ops Agent, Deployment & Validation Agent)
  - Proper dependencies between steps ensuring sequential execution
  - Specific inputs required and expected outputs for each step
  - Execution notes with practical guidance for AI agents
  - Complete coverage of the full workflow: validation → containerization → Helm chart generation → cluster optimization → deployment → validation

  The plan ensures all constitutional requirements are met, including no manual coding, local-first deployment on Minikube, and AI-assisted operations.
outcome: "Successfully created a detailed, agent-executable deployment plan for Phase IV following all constitutional requirements."
evaluation: "The plan covers all aspects of the deployment process with proper agent assignments and dependencies."
